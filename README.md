# React_portofolio_1
Here, Is my first ReactJS project. I created a clone of "HooBank" website with the help of Figma, ReactJS and Tailwind.
# Features:
  1. Single Page Application.
  2. Navigation within page.
  3. Using a single file to add all the data to make it easier for anyone to change the data on the page just by changing the data in the file: src/constants/index.js.
